It’s that time of year again to remind all of you to cancel your adobe subscription, tick the “too expensive” box and get a 50% discount for the entire year. Been doing this every year for a long time and works every time. 
... 
i think it only works if you do it around the time when it’s up for renewal
... 
If you speak to someone in the chat, you can get it for even cheaper, and they often give you a bunch of free months too. I think my average cost has been about £7 a month over the past 5 or 6 years 😂
