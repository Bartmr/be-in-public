## Warmup

Self-guided email warmup: Get your email address and domain ready for cold emailing

It’s tempting to dive in right now to start sending cold emails.

But if your email address suddenly jumps from sending a few emails every day to a large volume of (nearly) identical emails out of nowhere — that’s a red flag to the email providers you’re sending spam.

And that’s especially the case if you’re using a brand new email address and/or domain.

Before you start sending cold email it’s best to warm up your email address.

Now… there are email warmup tools that use an automated process to send emails from your account, open those emails, and sometimes reply to them, mark them as important, or mark them as “not spam.” The tools gradually ramp up the volume — starting from a small number of emails per day, then increasing.

We had one at GMass. Then Google decided to crack down on automated warmup tools — everyone knew it was only a matter of time until that would happen. So we stopped ours.

So you can and should run a self-guided warmup process. Basically: You gradually increase the number of emails you send every day, building to larger and larger sends. And as Google sees those emails are not spam — based on recipients opening, clicking, and replying — you’ll hit more and more people’s inboxes, not their spam folders.

Once your email is warm, you’re ready to send cold email — and land in the inbox. Without warming up your address, there’s a real risk of the majority of your emails going to spam.
