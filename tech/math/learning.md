Where can a developer learn to read notations like the one below?
P (V, BGPT3)=P (V |BGPT3)P (BGPT3).

A developer can learn to read notations like the one above by taking courses related to probability theory, mathematics, or statistics. Additionally, books and online resources on these topics can provide further guidance.

Give me concrete resources.
