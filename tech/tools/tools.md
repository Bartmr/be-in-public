  - Declare functions with code, and your internal users simply describe what they are trying to do in natural language. Razzle uses GPT-3 powered AI to chain and execute those functions in your code.
    - Example: you declare the functions `getClientsByAgeSegment` and `getInvoicesForClients` using regular code. Then, your internal users will write `Get me the invoices for all clients between 18 and 25 years`, and we allow GPT-3 to grab the available functions and chain them in the correct way for them to obtain the correct result for their natural language query.

  - CustomTkinter is a python UI-library based on Tkinter, which provides new, modern and fully customizable widgets. They are created and used like normal Tkinter widgets and can also be used in combination with normal Tkinter elements. The widgets and the window colors either adapt to the system appearance or the manually set mode ('light', 'dark'), and all CustomTkinter widgets and windows support HighDPI scaling (Windows, macOS). With CustomTkinter you'll get a consistent and modern look across all desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

  - Build high conversion flows without the dev time
  - Formsort empowers product teams to build and optimize their most important flows - onboarding, check-ins, quizzes and more.
  - Get the flexibility of custom coded flows, without needing to code. Your flow design should align with your overall brand and create an integrated digital experience. Use Formsort’s editor to get complete control over your flow. Customize every component, down to button styles and animations.
  - Personalize experiences for every responder. Set up conditional logic for common eligibility questions like age, address, etc. Enable complex, real-time calculations - like drug price lookup or mental health assessments - by populating answer choices from your backend via API.
  - Improve conversion through rapid experimentation. Speed up test cycles by making changes to flows and saving them as variants. Run multiple flow variants and compare their conversion rates through split testing.
  - Stop losing leads. Form abandonment is a common problem. Re-engage leads that gave up halfway through your flow through customized form data submission frequencies. Receive partial form responses, capture form data at specific save points, or only collect data when the form is submitted.
  - Integrate with your tech stack. Securely send information to your backend leveraging native integrations with BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Redshift, and Google Sheets. Use Webhooks for everything else. Send flow data to your favorite analytics tool for detailed funnel analytics: Segment, Google Analytics, Optimizely or Amplitude.
  - Maintain a high degree of data privacy and security. Data privacy has been a core part of Formsort’s philosophy since day 1. We won't store your data for the long term, and we're SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant.

  - Run your service in the context of your cloud environment, with access to other microservices, databases, queues, and managed services, all without leaving the local setup you know and love.
  - Speed up your feedback loop: Test your service in the cloud from your local machine, without CI or deployment.
  - No more complex and resource-intensive local setups. Plug the process you're developing (or even just your terminal) directly into your staging environment as you work, and quickly test out database commands, API calls to other services, and more.
  - mirrord runs in two places - in the memory of your local process, and as a pod in your cloud environment. The two components work together to fuse your local process with its remote counterpart so that inputs to the remote pod are mirrored to the local process, and outputs from the local process are tunnelled to the remote pod. This includes network traffic, file access, and environment variable - everything needed to make your local process “think” it's running in the cloud.
