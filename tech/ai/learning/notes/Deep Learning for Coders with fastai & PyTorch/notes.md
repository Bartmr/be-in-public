weights means the same as parameters

Using a pretrained model for a task different from what it was originally trained for is
known as transfer learning.

number of epochs: how many times to look at each image

fine-tuning
  - is the process of fitting a pre-trained model to your usecase
  - A transfer learning technique that updates the parameters of a pre‚Äêtrained model by training for additional epochs using a different task from that used for pretraining.

  - `kernel`
    - each kernel in a CNN is designed to recognize a type of pattern, like horizontal lines, vertical lines, corners, etc...
      - kernels detect these patterns by iterating the image with a grid, pulling some values from the pixels (Red, Green, Blue, Luminance channels) inside the grid and converting it into a matrix
