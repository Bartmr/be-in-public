1.  **Initialize Goal**: Define the objective for the AI.
2.  **Task Creation**: The AI checks its memory for the last X tasks completed (if any), and then uses it’s objective, and the context of it’s recently completed tasks, to generate a list of new tasks.
3.  **Task Execution**: The AI executes the tasks autonomously.
4.  **Memory Storage**: The task and executed results are stored in a vector database.
5.  **Feedback Collection**: The AI collects feedback on the completed task, either in the form external data or internal dialogue from the AI. This feedback will be used to inform the next iteration of the Adaptive Process Loop.
6.  **New Task Generation**: The AI generates new tasks based on the collected feedback and internal dialogue.
7.  **Task Prioritization**: The AI reprioritizes the task list by reviewing it’s objective and looking at the last task completed.
8.  **Task Selection**: The AI selects the top task from the prioritized list, and proceeds to execute them as described in step 3.
9.  **Iteration**: The AI repeats steps 4 through 8 in a continuous loop, allowing the system to adapt and evolve based on new information, feedback, and changing requirements.
