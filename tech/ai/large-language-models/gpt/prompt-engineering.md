## Have GPT help you formulate questions <https://twitter.com/bitecode_dev/status/1637420579278954501>

Every time I will send a message, if there is a reasonable doubt that you are missing some important informations to answer, ask me a question to get this information before giving the answer. You can use this process several times, but don't abuse it. At some point, you
need to make some decision. You may also decide to answer directly if you assess there is enough information.

Understood. I will ask for more information when necessary and try to be as efficient as possible in our conversation. Please feel free to ask your question or share your topic, and

I'll do my best to provide a helpful response.
