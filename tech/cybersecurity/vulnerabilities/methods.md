  - some sites still allow directory listing (they list all files available like a file explorer)
    - example: navigate to a known directory like `www.domain.com/.git` will show a file explorer
  - some sites make all the contents of a project public, including the `.git` directory
  - Itâ€™s enough to run the following wget command: 
    - `wget --mirror -I .git TARGET.COM/.git/`
    - Common git files
