The time of stock images is over. In our design process, we can't rely on AI's work, but we can use it as inspiration and research tool. Interesting ideas from Erik Kennedy in his recent newsletter Design Hacks (https://lnkd.in/ec2qhyjz):

– For AI Portraits, use Lexica Aperture (https://lnkd.in/eg8She9W),
– For AI headlines and CTAs, use ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com),
– For AI textures, icons and visual assets, use DALL-E (https://lnkd.in/emgnM3dy),
– For AI logos, use LogoAI (https://www.logoai.com/),
– For AI font picking, use ChatGPT,
– For AI image retouching, use Background Remover (https://lnkd.in/eem8_9Zh) and Remove Background (https://www.remove.bg/),
– For AI color palette generator, use Khroma (https://www.khroma.co),
– For AI image upscaling, use Let's Enhance (https://letsenhance.io/),

– For AI eye-tracking/heatmap testing, use Visualeyes (https://lnkd.in/eZvXJXzy),
