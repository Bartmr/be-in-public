Git is a pile of manila envelopes, stacked by time, and their contents describe what changes were made to previous work. Everybody sends their manila envelopes by mail to a central place.

- When you do `git add`, you are writing down the changes you did to the project
- When you do `git commit`, you are inserting the written down changes into a manila envelope and closing it
- When you `git push`, you are sending your manila envelope to your company
  - Sometimes, another person might have been chaning the same file you were changing, and got to send their changes to the company first. You need to get their work into your desk and pick to either keep their changes or apply yours.

- `git stash`: if you need to quickly move over your work from your workspace because you need to review another pile of changes, you can quickly get your changes out of the way and stash them

A git project is nothing more than the sum of all the changes that happened since its beginning

Github is not where you should focus on showcasing in order to get hired. The people needing developers, specially juniors, are not in the circles of developers. This happens in big corporations where HR and Recruiting is responsible for the initial steps of hiring, and statups where the co-founders are more busy keeping things afloat, than to judge someone's code. Only sometimes, in companies that develop products for developers, you might find someone hopping around Github profiles. And even then, Github discoverability features are very basic. It's not designed to find people, but potential libraries. Trying to sell in channels dominated by developers won't work. The people in charge of hiring are not there and also won't be able to judge you based on how good your Github projects are structured. Pick channels where your initial gate-keepers are, then, only after engaging them for a while, show them your Github. The analogy is: your LinkedIn and you going to events is your storefront. Github is what's inside on the shelves. You always need to start with a storefront, that's where people from all backgrounds pass by. Only interested people or people who already understand what you sell will go directly inside the store to check what's on the shelves.
