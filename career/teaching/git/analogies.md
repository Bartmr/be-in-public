Git is a pile of manila envelopes, stacked by time, and their contents describe what changes were made to previous work. Everybody sends their manila envelopes by mail to a central place.

- When you do `git add`, you are writing down the changes you did to the project
- When you do `git commit`, you are inserting the written down changes into a manila envelope and closing it
- When you `git push`, you are sending your manila envelope to your company
  - Sometimes, another person might have been chaning the same file you were changing, and got to send their changes to the company first. You need to get their work into your desk and pick to either keep their changes or apply yours.

- `git stash`: if you need to quickly move over your work from your workspace because you need to review another pile of changes, you can quickly get your changes out of the way and stash them
