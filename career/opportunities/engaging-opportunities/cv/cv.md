### Impossible + SyntheticUsers

> Aug 2022 - Apr 2023 (**9 months**) | Full-time

SyntheticUsers is a platform that gives you user interviews for product research and market validation, without real users. Through the use of AI, we emulate  specific audiences and demographics that you can interview and validate the market fit of your solution, without the need for sampling and recruiting people for user testing. It gives you a unique overview of your product, allowing you to uncover features and blockers, without spending as much time and money on user research.

#### Skills

- **AI**: GPT-3, ChatGPT, LangChain, Jupyter, Pinecone, Weaviate
- **Languages**: Python, Typescript, Javascript, Kotlin
- **Infrastructure**: Linux, Docker, Git
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL
- **Backend**: Node.js, NestJS, Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, Ant Design, HTML, CSS
- **No-code and 3rd party providers**: Firebase, n8n.io, Adalo, Retool, OpenBlocks, Miro

#### Roles

As the only MVP developer:

- Building multiple product drafts from scratch for user testing and market validation
- Implement no-code and low-code tools so that stakeholders could change business rules without needing developer time
- Implemented large language models months before their boom, together with fine-tuning and search utilities

As a team of 2 members (me included):

- Integrating a team and developing a final product that suits the requirements gathered from the previous product drafts.

#### Key Takeaways

- GPT-3 can behave like an agent that acts on its own in a product. It introduces intelligence in business logic, instead of it just being a set of strictly defined instructions
- Vector databases are an excellent way to search for content in the way that the user meant it
- Code needs to be more simpler than ever, and with as little in-house customization and libraries as possible, in order to be able to use the new wave of AI that generates code.
- That's why I try to keep the code as close as possible to the framework's and library's defaults, since Language Large Models like GPT-3 can then generate product code based on the documentation or past code it has been trained with.

#### Why it ended

Final product was finished and I was becoming redundant. I felt it was the right time for parent company to take it from there with their own in-house teams.

### Drawbotics + Mosaic

> Sep 2021 - Aug 2022 (**1 year**) | Full-time

Drawbotics offers everything a developer needs to sell his properties that are still off-plan. It offers innovative technologies like 3D renders of your properties, the ability to explore virtually the inside of properties (using our REVO technology), marketing materials, diffusion of your ads through many real-estate portals, and even a no-code tool to quickly build a landing page.

Mosaic is a CRM and end-to-end sales platform for property developers, powered by some of Drawbotics technologies

#### Skills

- **Infrastructure**: Heroku, Git
- **Backend**: GraphQL
- **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Emotion (CSS-in-JS), npm, Webpack, HTML, CSS

#### Roles

- Develop and maintain features in Drawbotics and Mosaic's many frontends
- Occasional development of React embedded in Rails views
- Internal tooling maintenance

#### Key Takeaways

- There are no perfect solutions, but the simplest one is normally the closest to what you want, and you can always change it quickly.
- 3rd party solutions save you time from dealing with problems that are not related to your company's expertise. If you are writing non-business related code, prepare for unpredictable maintenance that is not aligned with the company objectives.

#### Why it ended

Due to the lack of properties being built in the countries where Drawbotics was operating, the company had to freeze the activities in Mosaic, where I was mostly allocated. I was layed-off on the last day before the company underwent a freeze.

### Opplane

> Sep 2019 - Aug 2021 (**2 yrs**) | Full-time

Silicon Valley startup developing intelligent apps with machine learning and telco services

#### Skills

- **Infrastructure**: AWS, GCP, Linux, Terraform, Docker, Linux, Apache Kafka, Git
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Presto
- **Languages**: Javascript, Typescript, Java, Kotlin, Python
- **Backend**: Node.js, NestJS, Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, Gatsby, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Sass
- **Mobile**: React Native, Android, iOS, Expo
- **No-code and 3rd party providers**: Pubnub, Firebase
- **Soft-skills**: planning, estimating, hiring

#### Roles

- Design and develop full-stack apps (database, workers and recurring processing of data, backend, auditing, web and mobile apps) for various clients in the finance and health sector.
- Architect project structures, tools and frameworks
- Direct support, planning and feedback with clients
- Conducting job interviews for developer positions

#### Key Takeaways

- Most projects have a large chunk of workload that is common to any IT project, yet, it's still re-written and maintained multiple times in separate teams. That chunk can be shared with multiple projects and be maintained once whenever needed.
- Build explicitly, rather than implicity. A developer has a limited memory about the project, while new developers onboarding the team don't even know about the project. Projects should be aimed at being built in a way that anybody can get fully and quickly onboarded, without needing to wait for other team members. This means avoiding having "little quirks in order change something or make the project work". Building explicitly is also useful for the developers already in the team, when they have to re-visit features after a long time.

#### Why it ended

The workload and amount of parallel projects started to be too much for me. During COVID, I also decided that it would be wise to start working for other countries again and have a more serious B2B setup.

### Zenklub

> Sep 2018 - Sep 2019 (**1 year and 1 month**) | Full-time

Zenklub is a B2C and B2B mental healthcare provider in Brazil.

It offers many features, the main ones being a marketplace of therapists where you can book and pay appointments with the web or mobile app, and services that give you insights regarding your employees mental health.

Today they are the biggest provider of online mental health care in Brazil, and used by a lot of big companies as a perk for maintaining employee well-being.

#### Skills

- **AI**: IBM Watson
- **Languages**: Typescript, Javascript, C#
- **Infrastructure**: Azure, AWS, AWS Lambda, Linux, Docker, WebRTC, Rabbit MQ, Git
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Backend**: Node.js, Serverless Framework, Loopback, ASP.NET
- **Frontend**: React.js, Angular 5, Puppeteer, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Sass
- **Mobile**: React Native, Android, iOS
- **No-code and 3rd party providers**: Firebase, OneSignal, Applozic, Typeform, Jitsee Meet, Janus

#### Roles

Together with the CTO:

- Rebuilt the company's engineering side from the small MVP it once was, in a smooth transition that never locked the development of new features, and allowed to slowly move away from the legacy MVP.
- Maintaining the following services
  - ASP.NET legacy server
  - AWS Lambda gateway and business logic
  - Loopback persistence server
  - React Native user-facing app
  - Angular Website for scheduling, payments and live therapy sessions
  - Angular Back-office

#### Key Takeaways

- A project should be treated as a whole, and not has separate stacks: backend, web-app, mobile app, etc... Sharing code between stacks is essential not just for avoiding redundant work, but also for keeping the whole project stable and avoid miscommunications between teams and team members (like missing properties in data exchanges between backend and frontend)

#### Why it ended

After a year of building multiple services with tight deadlines, my tasks started to be things that many developers could do in parallel without breaking the product. We had raised some funding and my objective after a year was to get a salary raise, but the funds were aimed at getting more developers, which was necessary for the company. I decided to resign since each side had different needs and switched to another company.

### Farfetch

> Dec 2017 - Sep 2018 (**10 months**) | Full-time

Farfetch is a British-Portuguese online luxury fashion retail platform that sells products from over 700 boutiques and brands from around the world.

#### Skills

- **Languages**: Javascript, C#
- **Infrastructure**: Azure, Git
- **Storage**: Apache Cassandra
- **Backend**: ASP.NET
- **Frontend**: jQuery, HTML, CSS, Sass, PostCSS
- **Build Systems**: Gulp, Webpack, MSBuild

#### Roles

In a team responsible for maintaining and evolving the cross-cutting layout of the main website.

Some highlighted personal tasks were:
- improving Javascript and Post-CSS build system
- Proof-of-concept: migration from Gulp to Webpack with Hot Module Replacement
- improving MSBuild configs

These were all tasks designed to improve the development speed, that was very slow, sometimes having to wait 1 minute for the computer to build and show the changes on the screen

#### Key takeaways

- There are no shortcuts. Like any other engineering practice, something rushed now will have consequences in the future
- Tools and code should be the things that catch errors before they're deployed and not your brain. You should be focused on new features, not having to remind yourself of many things that can fail: that job is for compilers and linters
- If the above takeaway is present in your workday, you should write code for what you know and you're sure in the present, and not try to write it for the future. Requirements and environments change, and it's actually safer to write code is thought out for a single situation, and not an over-engineered code that is expecting a non-existing future. Code that is written with only the present requirements in mind is easier to replace and discard. We need to know where to let it go and embrace some of the chaos in our favor.

#### Why it ended

Although one of the best companies in Portugal to work for, in my opinion, the organization wasn't very open to change. Every task required a lot of back-and-forth in approvals and it was hard to optimize the work for yourself.

Usually IPOs make this bureaucracy worst, so I decided to leave after knowing that Farfetch was going to be a public company, and pursue an opportunity that would give me more ownership and would allow me to learn how to build a wider range of products.

### Yelloh

> Aug 2017 - Dec 2017 (**5 months**) | Full-stime

Video-based online surveys, right from the browser.

#### Skills

- **Languages**: Javascript, Flow
- **Infrastructure**: AWS, WebRTC, Git
- **Storage**: MongoDB
- **Backend**: Node.js, FeathersJS
- **Frontend**: React, Semantic UI, HTML, CSS, Less
- **Build Systems**: Webpack

#### Roles

Together with the CTO:

- build the following services from scratch:
  - web-app for users to see the questions and record themselves
  - back-office for companies to check their survey results
  - server

#### Key Takeaways

- Developers need to see their changes in the code immediately and without much hassle. The feedback must be almost as fast as changing something on Photoshop. No reloads or compilation times. Hot reload seems to be the best solution in these cases

#### Why it ended

Recording a video of yourself answering questions wasn't a widespread practice amongst consumers. 4G was a reality, but cheap data plans and stable video recording APIs for mobile browsers weren't. The companies using our product were testing it but not paying for it. Failing to get a round of investment, the company closed after 5 months.

Today, companies measure part of their success by analyzing recorded feedback in platforms like TikTok and Instagram. A lot of companies today do what we did before.

### CGI

> Jan 2017 - Jun 2017 (**6 mos**) | Full-time

Founded in 1976, CGI is among the largest IT and business consulting services firms in the world.

#### Skills

- **Languages**: Javascript, Java
- **Infrastructure**: Linux, Git
- **Backend**: SpringMVC
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Angular 1, Material UI, HTML, CSS
- **Build Systems**: Gulp

#### Roles

- Develop an NGO resources management app using SpringMVC and AngularJS.

#### Key Takeaways

- Legacy code can be manageable if the early developers put simplicity as a priority, and organize software based on its business features and requirements and not based solely on the technology's needs and one-size-fits-all structures.

#### Why it ended

After a while, I was moved to a non-technological position that required inputing data in a proprietary database used only in Portugal. That seemed like a dangerous path to take as a junior, since I wouldn't be learning something that would help me evolve as a developer. I decided to learn Node.js and pursue my original objective of building products from scratch as a full-stack developer.

## Personal Projects

### Be in Public

> Mar 2023 - Present

> 🌐 <https://github.com/Bartmr/be-in-public>

A public repository of my daily notes, automations, work processes and knowledge bases.

#### Skills

- **AI**: Jupyter
- **Languages**: Python, Bash
- **Infrastructure**: Git

### Docker Workspaces

> May 2022 - Present

> 🌐 <https://github.com/Bartmr/docker-workspaces>

Protecting my data and client's data, by running day-to-day apps in isolated environments

Regular software and files share the same user session in the computer. They can read each other, which means, malware can read your files and passwords without even issuing a warning.

In order to protect my data and clients data, I run all projects and day-to-day software in individual Docker containers, so that none of them can access data outside their scope.

Collaborators can assure an extra layer of security to their clients, in a increasingly remote work environment where everybody uses their own personal devices, with their own baggage from previous projects, jobs and activities.

#### Skills

- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Linux, Git
- **Languages**: Bash

### Bootstrap 5.1 with automatic color contrast

> Aug 2021 - Aug 2022

> 🌐 <https://github.com/Bartmr/public-archive/tree/main/bootstrap-5.1-auto-contrast>

Usually when you start a product, the stakeholders want to try out new brandings and different designs. With conventional CSS and design frameworks, that means if the primary brand color changes from a dark color to a light color, the developer must change all of the text colors in all pages and all screens, in order to contrast with their background and keep their visibility. This also happens when the product needs to have dark mode.

With this modified variation of Bootstrap, the components become aware of their background color, and automatically switch to the best contrasting colors.

#### Skills

- **Frontend**: CSS, Sass

### 8Land

> Feb 2022 - Aug 2022

> 🌐 <https://github.com/Bartmr/8land>

Pixelart RPG game with lands built by everyone.

8Land is an open pixel-art RPG game where players design their own lands and launch their own public games. The objective is to have the gameplay of Decentraland and the feel and nostalgia of Pokemon Gold and Silver.

An example of how a project with some complexity can be maintained by a single (or few) people, by placing a few simple abstractions in the right place, static-analysis in data contracts between client and server, and sticking to simplicity.

#### Skills

- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Linux, DigitalOcean, Git
- **Languages**: Typescript, Javascript
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL
- **Backend**: Node.js, NestJS
- **Frontend**: React.js, Gatsby, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Sass
- **Build systems**: Webpack
- **No-code and 3rd party providers**: Firebase

### Estirador

> August 2021 - Aug 2022

> 🌐 <https://bartolomeu-rodrigues.com/estirador/>

Centralize all of your the projects engineering foundations in a single place. Start projects fast, fix bugs once.

Estirador is an upgradable boilerplate that packs most of the engineering foundations you need for a full-stack project, so you can start writing business logic right away.

It comes with an update system that allows your projects to keep up with the boilerplate improvements and fixes as time moves on.

#### Skills

- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Linux, Git
- **Languages**: Typescript, Javascript, Bash
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL
- **Backend**: Node.js, NestJS
- **Frontend**: React.js, Gatsby, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Sass
- **Build systems**: Webpack

### Not-me

> August 2021 - Aug 2022

> 🌐 <https://github.com/Bartmr/not-me>

Unifies data validation across frontend and backend, compile-time and runtime

This library allows you to describe the types of data that circulate in your project once, and use it in both backend (endpoint validation) and frontend (form validations), and also as Typescript types, with little overhead.

Reduces bugs caused by different data contracts describing the same information

#### Skills

- **Infrastructure**: npm, Git
- **Languages**: Typescript, Javascript
