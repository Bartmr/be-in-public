### Impossible + SyntheticUsers

> Aug 2022 - Apr 2023 (**9 months**) | Full-time

SyntheticUsers is a platform that gives you user interviews for product research and market validation, without real users. Through the use of AI, we emulate  specific audiences and demographics that you can interview and validate the market fit of your solution, without the need for sampling and recruiting people for user testing. It gives you a unique overview of your product, allowing you to uncover features and blockers, without spending as much time and money on user research.

#### Skills

- AI: GPT-3, ChatGPT, LangChain, Jupyter, Pinecone, Weaviate
- Languages: Python, Typescript, Javascript, Kotlin
- Infrastructure: Linux, Docker
- Storage: PostgreSQL
- Backend: Node.js, NestJS, Spring Boot
- Frontend: React.js, Next.js, Ant Design, HTML, CSS
- No-code: Firebase, n8n.io, Adalo, Retool, OpenBlocks
- 3rd party APIs: Miro

#### Roles

- Building multiple product drafts from scratch as a sole MVP developer for user testing and market validation.
- Integrating a team and developing a final product that suits the requirements gathered from the previous product drafts.
- Implement no-code and low-code tools so that stakeholders could change business rules without needing developer time
- Implemented large language models months before their boom, together with fine-tuning and search utilities

#### Key Takeaways

- GPT-3 can behave like an agent that acts on its own in a product. It introduces intelligence in business logic, instead of it just being a set of strictly defined instructions
- Vector databases are an excellent way to search for content in the way that the user meant it
- Code needs to be more simpler than ever, and with as little in-house customization and libraries as possible, in order to be able to use the new wave of AI that generates code.
- That's why I try to keep the code as close as possible to the framework's and library's defaults, since Language Large Models like GPT-3 can then generate product code based on the documentation or past code it has been trained with.

#### Why it ended

- Final product was finished and I was becoming redundant. I felt it was the right time for parent company to take it from there with their own in-house teams.

### Drawbotics + Mosaic

> Sep 2021 - Aug 2022 (**1 year**) | Full-time

Drawbotics offers everything a developer needs to sell his properties that are still off-plan. It offers innovative technologies like 3D renders of your properties, the ability to explore virtually the inside of properties (using our REVO technology), marketing materials, diffusion of your ads through many real-estate portals, and even a no-code tool to quickly build a landing page.

Mosaic is a CRM and end-to-end sales platform for property developers, powered by some of Drawbotics technologies

#### Skills

- Infrastructure: Heroku
- Backend: GraphQL
- Frontend: React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Emotion CSS, npm, Webpack, HTML, CSS

#### Roles

- Develop and maintain features in Drawbotics and Mosaic's many frontends
- Occasional development of React embedded in Rails views
- Internal tooling maintenance

#### Key Takeaways

- There are no perfect solutions, but the simplest one is normally the closest to what you want, and you can always change it quickly.
- 3rd party solutions save you time from dealing with problems that are not related to your company's expertise. If you are writing non-business related code, prepare for unpredictable maintenance that is not aligned with the company objectives.

#### Why it ended

Due to the lack of properties being built in the countries where Drawbotics was operating, the company had to freeze the activities in Mosaic, where I was mostly allocated. I was layed-off on the last day before the company underwent a freeze.

### Opplane

> Sep 2019 - Aug 2021 (**2 yrs**) | Full-time

#### Skills

- Infrastructure: AWS, GCP, Linux, Terraform, Docker, Linux
- Storage: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Presto
- Languages: Javascript, Typescript, Java, Kotlin, Python
- Backend: Node.js, NestJS, Spring Boot
- Frontend: React.js, Next.js, Gatsby
- Mobile: React Native, Android, iOS, Expo
- 3rd party APIs: Pubnub, Firebase

#### Why it ended

The workload and amount of parallel projects started to be too much for me. During COVID, I also decided that it would be wise to start working for other countries again and have a more serious B2B setup.

### Zenklub

#### Why it ended

After a year of building multiple services with tight deadlines, my tasks started to be things that many developers could do in parallel without breaking the product. We had raised some funding and my objective after a year was to get a salary raise, but the funds were aimed at getting more developers, which was necessary for the company. I decided to resign and switch to another company.
