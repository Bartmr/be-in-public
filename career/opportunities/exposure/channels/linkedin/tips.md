## picking the right skills

### Inbound traffic
Open some LinkedIn job postings, and check what skills they require. See the exact names used in the skills, and pick the most common ones, since they're the ones recruiters usually use. This will give you more incoming messages.

### Outbound traffic
Write down specific technologies you worked with. Only jobs that specifically need this skill will have this skill on their list. Those job descriptions are written by either someone who knows what they need, or a startup that needs to leverage that exact technology. 

Example: `Frontend development` will get you inbound traffic for all things related to frontend. But `Bootstrap` will show you all positions that specifically need Bootstrap. Could be a company that just bought a template, or has a legacy codebase, and, without a doubt, need that specific knowledge. Same thing for something like `WebRTC`. It won't get you a lot of Inbound traffic, but you will be able to target companies that definetly need that skill.
