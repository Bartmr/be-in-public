Most performance review processes are bad, cumbersome and offer very little insights into both the receiving end and the reviewer. So I want to propose an easier, more pragmatic way. 👇

Before explaining my framework, it’s important to mention it only works if your team, group or organization (not company) has their own values or principles. These are the pillars that guide how everyone acts when nobody is seeing. They should make the culture of your team’s execution tangible. (Check the comments for a post on my own organizations principles).

Now back to the review. There are 5 sections in this template:

🚀Top 3 traits

These are based on the T3B3 framework. Focus where each person stands out (T3) and where they are strong.

🚧Bottom 3 traits

Again on the same framework, this is where there is still work to be done (B3).

For this first part focus on bullet points and lists só to keep it light to write and, more importantly, easy to remember.

🔮Role expectation vs Reality

Each person should know a) what their seniority is, b) what is expected performance for that seniority. Then, point by point, you compare the last timebox performance vs the expected one. Where did a person performed (met expectation), where they surprised (exceeded) and where you expected more (below).

✅Most followed principle

This is where the final kick comes in: if you believe following your org’s principles generates maximum impact, then it’s important to assess where each person is strong at and where they need to work on. It gives you a canvas to provide more open feedback, but still keep it actionable (get closer to principles).

The top followed principle should highlight where this person is being a bar-raiser of culture and celebrate them. It’s also an area they can coach others that don’t follow as well.

❌Least followed principle

On the reverse side, there is always one (or more) principles your team could be stronger at. This feedback helps them know where you expect more. It’s especially important for senior people or managers.

The best part: everything in this review can be bullet-list, making it easy to write and read, actionable for both parties, and gets everyone back to the product building without sacrificing something extremely important: feedback.
