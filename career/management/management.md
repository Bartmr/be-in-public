## Article: Employees can be small scale CEOs

How splitting code by feature might raise your teams morale, since each feature can be delivered and managed as a bit of territory by a single employee, making him accountable for better or for worst for the outcome of that feature

This concept is similar to code, where a certain block of code only has to have an API and the rest of the implementation is on the creator

It also makes onboarding and focus much better since you only have to know a single feature and quirks and be responsible to communicate it


The feeling of punishment or reward, and the responsibility to communicate and manage a small feature is what gives life to your work and the feeling of meritocracy, the idea that you have the power to prove yourself. That you are sensible to what the feature is like it were a pet. It's life

You are also free to automate even more your work and be rewarded by it
