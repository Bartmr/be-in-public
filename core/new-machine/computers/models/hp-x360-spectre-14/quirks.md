        acpi_osi=! acpi_osi="Windows 2009"
        The first part, acpi_osi=! , means "forget any acpi_osi strings that you know at this point" (it's actually a list of strings, rather than just one string, apparently - duh). So we first clear whatever the interpretter originally used, and then set the one desired string. To make it work with a modern Linux kernel, it might be a good idea to specify the most modern Windows version that the BIOS nominally supports.

          Note on acpi_osi=!

          This argument disables all vendor strings that maybe present. It should only be used if one of the above OSI strings does not work on its own. If you use it when it is not needed, you maybe able to boot without any acpi errors, but your touchpad or wifi will not work. It also must be used in combination one of the above OSI strings.
          ```

        ```
        acpi_osi=!*             # remove all strings

    - Override pin 0x14 and set it to Internal Speaker (LFE). I believe this enables the amplifier that drives the top speakers. Setting it to something other than just "Internal Speaker" is important, so that pulseaudio does not try to redirect sound to that channel.
    - Override pin 0x1e and set them to "Internal Speaker".

  Installing iio-sensor-proxy and screenrotator-gitAUR, autorotation works out of the box except for pen input (does not get rotated). Instead of screenrotator-git, you can use this script which auto rotates the touchpad, touch screen, and pen.
  - Laptop wakes up with wrong orientation
- Touchscreen Pressure Sensitivity
  The touchscreen seems to use the libinput driver by default, with which pressure sensitivity with the included HP Pen does not work. To get pressure sensitivity install xf86-input-evdev and force the use of the evdev driver:
  ```
  /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-touchscreen.conf
  Section "InputClass"
      Identifier "Touchscreen"
      MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event11"
      Driver "evdev"
  EndSection
  ```
  The touchscreen should be at /dev/input/event11, but to make sure you can use a utility like evtest and verify the location of your touchscreen by testing the input events.

    - Add `i8042.dumbkbd=1` to kernel arguments 
    ```
    Thank you VERY much. I followed the steps and links from your link, and it's worked beautifully. I rebooted and suspended 3 times each, and the keyboard worked instantly on all occasions. The only tiny downside is the caps-lock LED no longer works. But who cares about that?

    I used information gathered from a couple of threads, and some posts from another forum. So in case anybody else has this problem, I shall bring all that info together here and set out my exact steps below.

    Step 1

    Add a temporary kernal parameter, which is a one-boot test.

    1) Load your grub menu
    2) Highlight the relevant Linux boot entry
    3) Type e to edit
    4) On the Linux line, after it says "quiet splash" add i8042.dumbkbd=1

    For example:
    CODE: SELECT ALL

    linux   /boot/vmlinuz-5.8.0-53-generic root=UUID=12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789abc ro quiet splash i8042.dumbkbd=1 
    5) Press F10 to boot
    6) Use cat /proc/cmdline to confirm that parameter was specified
    7) If your keyboard worked instantly without delay, then your issue is likely now solved, so proceed to step 2 for a permanent fix.


    Step 2

    Add a permanent kernal parameter.

    1) Use sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    2) You should now see a line which reads:
    CODE: SELECT ALL

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
    3) Edit it to read:
    CODE: SELECT ALL

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash i8042.dumbkbd=1"
    4) Save the file. This is where I was slightly stumped. In the end I hit ctrl + s, then shut Terminal using the red x. When the warning said "There is still a process running in the terminal. Closing the terminal will kill it". I clicked on "Close Terminal". This worked for me, although I have no idea if this was the precise action I should have taken. Perhaps you know better than me.
    5) Run sudo update-grub
    6) Reboot
    7) Use cat /proc/cmdline to confirm that parameter was specified.
    8) Enjoy feelings of triumph as your keyboard now works normally, except for the caps-lock LED light.
