## Aggregate all notes repositories into a single repository

- Improves indexing speed
- Single vault, less switching

Create a single repository called `all-notes` that aggregates all your notes repositories as *git submodules*. Open this repository as a vault, and it will save a single commitable `.obsidian` directory for all your notes. This will also reduce the amount of vault switching you do during the day, and can speed up Obsidian indexing.
