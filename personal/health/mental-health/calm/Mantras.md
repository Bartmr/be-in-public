- If it's not written down, it doesn't matter and doesn't exist
  - Writing should be the only communication you have with the past and the future
  - writing down makes the knowledge and events available to others, be they humans or machines
  - writing down works as a filter for what is worth the focus and what is just something that came out of fear or a distraction
  - sticking to what is written down helps you focus and helps you act only on what's important
  - it keeps you clear headed, since you don't need to retain anything in your mind 
  - it allows you to completely turn off from a stressful task, and come back later with a fresh mentality and a positive outlook
  - writing will also make the events and knowledge accessible to AI automation
  - There will be a time when your knowledge and actions need to be so vast, and the world and your days change so quickly, that you won't be able to keep up unless you start writing down what needs to be done and using text as your only short-term memory.
    - There will be so much happening and changing, that rumination itself will be pointless, and based on misconstructed ideas and patterns in your brain. You will need to stick and act only to what is written
    - Using text as your short-term memory will be a full replacement. It's a deal: you must trust what you wrote and you cannot ruminate on short-term things anymore
    - Stopping yourself from ruminating on your thoughts is no longer just a mental health choice. It's a necessity in order going and keep evolving
      - ruminating will only stall you

- Dont spend more than 5 minutes on something that doesn't matter in 5 years

- Past and future are mental constructs, build on old evolutionary patterns that are no longer suited for modern society. With past comes remorse or wishing to go back and with the future comes anxiety or over-confidence. The present is the only moment you can use and act upon, the simplest and closest to reality.
  - any time you remember something, or try to predict something, what you see is already a construct of your prejudices and faulty brain mechanics
  - Do not identify yourself with the past or future. Your brain cannot conceive a realistic past or a realistic future.
  - Do not identify or attach to what you accumulated. What you feel as the value of what you accumulated is still a subjective picture made out of biases from your brain. And don't forget that the world also changes a lot, and what you feel is valuable can no longer be considered valuable or useful in the present. Given this scenario, the best alternative is to always be moving on, and treat accumulation as a bonus, something extra that you don't depend on.
    - One way of measuring this is picturing the following scenario: if you were dropped in the middle of nowhere, with no possessions, how much time would it take for you to regain your lifestyle, or to gain another satisfatory lifestyle?

- the simplest solution is always the one closest to being the best
  - complex solutions usually come from our own bad habits and our toxic side
  - stress and anxiety are just added complexity. We just start adding complexity to the situation. 

- There are no certainties, only faith

- Cortisol and adrenaline from stress tampers with our cognitive ability. It's a paradox: if we don't worry, everything will be fine.
  - these hormones makes your body focus on movement and be ready to physically strike. It shifts the attention to a single thing: physical action. That means no focus can be spent on acting with your mind. How can that type of pinpoint focus help you find a solution in the modern world? How can it give you mental range for you to act mentally in the present?

- Our brain is a meatball on stilts, poorly designed for the jungle and not for modern society. Don't take it seriously. It doesn't make many favours for us. 
  - Your brain will never be able to grasp what the reality really is, and its wide range of opportunities, happenings, contexts and unlimited points of view.

- Asking yourself "Who do you want to be" is a good way to stop bad habits on the spot

- Your luck increases if you just trust the present

- Worry, stress and rumination are the brake. Trying to be certain of anything is the brake. Trusting the present is the gas pedal. It moves your life.

- Bad habits creep in as if nothing changed. Be wary of that.
  - rumination for example, makes you think that the current scenario is different from the past ones, and that you definitely need to worry now

- Opportunities of growth can only be seized in the present. 

- Everything is permanently changing, even if you don't notice. 
  - The world doesn't stop for you to plan or ruminate on something 

- Picture yourself detaching your worry or other toxic emotion from yourself, and only having left the present moment

- Since the world moves so fast, sometimes is healthy to subtract things from you, specially those that you identify more with or think that are essential. It will leave room for adaptation. You can detach anything from your mind and live better days. 

- The best solutions are the ones built when the problem happened and materialized itself, since you finally have the whole context right in front of you.

- The best thing you can do when worrying is to force yourself to do other thing. It will change your focus in your brain, and you will soon accept that there are always alternatives in this world.
  - Worry is never truthful, but a result from how our brains work
  - you will see that the thing you we're worrying isn't important at all to act on, or has a very simple solution
  - letting worry go past you, and let the effects of stress leave your body. Act like nothing happened

- Always be as light as you can in your mind
  - give permission to yourself to not depend on anything
    - you won't die
    - it's a leap of faith for a better life
    - weight in our minds is a result of our "meatball" brain (see above)
  - it makes room for adaptation and incorporate new things
  - it simplifies your life
  - it makes it easier to find alternatives and get new ideas

- Your mind is still yours. You can focus on anything you choose to.
