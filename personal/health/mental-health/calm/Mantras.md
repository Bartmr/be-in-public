- If it's not written down, it doesn't matter and doesn't exist
  - Writing should be the only communication you have with the past and the future
  - writing down makes the knowledge and events available to others, be they humans or machines
  - writing down works as a filter for what is worth the focus and what is just something that came out of fear or a distraction
  - sticking to what is written down helps you focus and helps you act only on what's important
  - it keeps you clear headed, since you don't need to retain anything in your mind 
  - it allows you to completely turn off from a stressful task, and come back later with a fresh mentality and a positive outlook
  - There will be a time when your knowledge and actions need to be so vast, and the world and your days change so quickly, that you won't be able to keep up unless you start writing down what needs to be done and using text as your only short-term memory.
    - There will be so much happening and changing, that rumination itself will be pointless, and based on misconstructed ideas and patterns in your brain
    - Using text as your short-term memory will be a full replacement. It's a deal: you must trust what you wrote and you cannot ruminate on short-term things anymore
    - Stopping yourself from ruminating on your thoughts is no longer just a mental health choice. It's a necessity in order going and keep evolving
      - You will not be able to retain or ruminate anything in your head. If you do, you will stall, not be able to adapt to new contexts and new days, and you will crash mentally

- Dont spend more than 5 minutes on something that doesn't matter in 5 years

- Past and future are mental constructs, build on old evolutionary patterns that are no longer suited for modern society. With past comes remorse or wishing to go back and with the future comes anxiety or over-confidence. The present is the only useful moment, the simplest, and closest to reality.
  - any time you remember something, or try to predict something, what you see is already a construct of your prejudices and faulty brain mechanics

- the simplest solution is always the one closest to being the best
  - complex solutions usually come from our own bad habits and our toxic side
  - stress and anxiety are just added complexity. We just start adding complexity to the situation. 

- There are no certainties, only faith

- Cortisol and adrenaline from stress tampers with our cognitive ability. It's a paradox: if we don't worry, everything will be fine.

- Our brain is a meatball poorly designed for the jungle. Don't take it seriously. It doesn't make many favours for us. 

- Asking yourself "Who do you want to be" is a good way to stop bad habits on the spot

- Your luck increases if you just trust the present

- Worry, stress and rumination are the brake. Trying to be certain of anything is the brake. Trusting the present is the gas pedal. It moves your life.

- Bad habits creep in as if nothing changed. Be wary of that.
  - rumination for example, makes you think that the current scenario is different from the past ones, and that you definitely need to worry now

- Opportunities of growth can only be seized in the present.
