- Let it go and keep on with your day. The rumination will disappear after a while

- Remember that you went through this countless times, and you always let the rumination go, and after a while you couldn't even understand how you were worried about something so senseless. Also, the things you were ruminating about never happened.

- acknowledge that the picture of reality you have in your head is a very bad interpretation made by a faulty nervous system, and that the real reality is way more complex and is running in a completely different dimensions and contexts
  - Different moods mean different views about the world. Sometimes you just need to change your standing point.
