HOW TO PREVENT AN ANXIETY ATTACK

- Breathe deeply in through your nose and out
through your mouth

- Slowly look around you and find...

- 5 things you can see

- 4 things you can touch

- 3 things you can hear

- 2 things you can smell (or 2 smells you like)

- 1 emotion you feel

This is called GROUNDING - it can help when you feel like you've gone too far in your head and lost all control of your surroundings.
