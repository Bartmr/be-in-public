A repository with my notes, procedures and snippets that I use in my daily life 

My drafts and my notes IN PUBLIC.

I see a lot of #build-in-public in social media feeds. I also have a bunch of notes and procedures that I build everyday for my career and personal life. 

So I'm going to start a #be-in-public and post my notes and insights in a public repository where others can give me advice while also reusing knowledge I stored or built. 

Be free to open a PR with advice

One more window of transparency where you can see my procedures and methodologies
