I see a lot of #build-in-public stuff here. I don't have a product, but I have a bunch of notes and procedures I build everyday for my career and personal life. 

So I'm going to start a #be-in-public and post my notes and insights in a public repository where others can give me advice while also reusing knowledge I stored or built. 

Be free to open a PR with advice
